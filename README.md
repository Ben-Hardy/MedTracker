# MedTracker

I wanted to learn how to make Android applications properly since I had only
dabbled in them a bit but had fun when I did.

MedTracker is a medication tracking app. The user adds medications that they are
taking then adds entries every time they take the medications in real life.

So far it just tracks medications and medication entries. Entries can be filtered
by date or medication to help the user understand usage patterns.

If you wish to see the actual XML and Java code, it can be found in the directory `./app/src/main/java/ben/medtracker`. Gotta love Java project directory structures.

#### Future features I'd like to add:

- Reminders/Notifications to take medications
- Statistics about medications being taken
- A user interface that is more elaborate

#### How to run MedTracker

To run MedTracker, one must have Android Studio installed. It does not use
any external libraries or APIs so it should be simple to get working. From
the introduction window in Android Studio, select "Import project" and
select the MedTracker directory from wherever you have it stored on your system.
